# Defense Vs Offense Win Championships
## Project Description - Term Project for DSC530

For this term project, an evaluation of defensive importance within the National Basketball Association (NBA) will be conducted, to determine if the adage of ‘Defense Wins Championships!’ remains accurate in today’s game. Since sports have been played and a score kept, there have been coaches, sideline parents, armchair experts, and others declaring the importance of defense. While defense is an integral part of most team-oriented sports, is it the most important aspect of winning? Does the best defense have a better chance at winning a championship in comparison to the best offense?
