# Defense or Offense Win Championships
Term Project for DSC530
## Project Description

For this term project, an evaluation of defensive importance within the National Basketball Association (NBA) will be conducted, to determine if the adage of ‘Defense Wins Championships!’ remains accurate in today’s game. Since sports have been played and a score kept, there have been coaches, sideline parents, armchair experts, and others declaring the importance of defense. While defense is an integral part of most team-oriented sports, is it the most important aspect of winning? Does the best defense have a better chance at winning a championship in comparison to the best offense?  

Many modern professional leagues have adapted over time to account for player safety, obtaining higher viewership/ratings, fan interest in higher scoring games, and shortened attention spans. By doing so, gameplay has also changed from era to era. Athletes have increased in size and ability, creating discrepancies in performance when comparing eras. Taking into consideration these variations, the focus will be on the past decade (2009 – 2019) for evaluation. With many professional leagues to choose from, it is believed the NBA provides some of the best data to capture and analyze. When evaluating the three major professional sports in the US, Major League Baseball and the National Football League were eliminated based on the following:  

  1.	National Football League – While defense plays a very vital role in football, it is one of three teams taking the field at any given point. Being broken into camps of offense, special teams, and defense, to state that one is more important than the other takes away from the value provided by the other two units. 
  2.	Major League Baseball – Baseball is a one-on-one sport wrapped in the disguise of a team-oriented sport. Much like football, many aspects of baseball can be broken into team or individual elements. With basketball, pace of play is high and engagement in both offense and defense is required. 

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from [Basketball-Reference.Com](www.basketball-reference.com/) (BRC). Each season was downloaded and saved to a CSV file. This was the simplest approach taken, due to time constraints. By doing so, the data files from BRC we evaluated and did not require additional data cleansing. A focus was placed on more advanced metrics being utilized by the NBA in determining the importance of defense in today's game.

A [Glossary of Terms](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) can help expand on any variables this project does or does not utilize.

## Tools
A standard EDA approach was taken. All coding was completed with Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

### What do you feel was missed during the analysis? Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis? Were there any assumptions made you felt were incorrect?
In terms of looking at the project to see if there were missed steps during analysis, incorrect assumptions, or additional variables that could have benefitted the analysis, the answer is yes. As with any model, more data and input could help strengthen the predictive power. Additionally, two main assumptions made (offense is dominating modern game play and rule changes effecting game play over time) could have been worked through before being narrowed down. The project does a good job of understanding the past ten seasons, but in retrospect, it would be interesting to trend the data to see if there are changes over time. Additionally, if changes are found, dig deeper to discover the fundamental cause of those changes.
### What challenges did you face, what did you not fully understand?
Luckily, there were not many challenges faced along the way that would fall outside of the scope of any project. By working with sports data, the data was very clean from the beginning and thus allowed for more time on understanding what the data contained. There was worry when bringing the entire project together that areas of unknown would cloud and cause missteps to be taken, but that does not seem to be the case. Certainly there are spots that can be improved upon and maybe errors made that I do not realize I have made, but all and all, focusing on a topic of interest helped in my understanding of each criteria needed to complete the project.
